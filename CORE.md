> I want this to be three.js submarine welding simulator. Tool to hot-fix underwater infrastructure issues. This must be possible to multiplay with 2 players on the same keyboard or 
through the keyboard and RADIOMASTER POCKET. But STRONG single player too. let's make 2 control modes: one for submarine removal with just keyboard, another with RADIOMASTER POCKET VJOY 
joystick for precise control. Plan ahead how to use keyboard and joystick features for in simulator controls. Game UI should always display hotkey to use feature. Submarine must have 
multiple camera views. each view should be ~160x256 pixels in the dashboard and there should be 4 of them. Parameters adjusted to specifics of the job - welding related camera, submarine 
position related to the surroundings, minimap, score, hints, radar, sonar, flashlight. UI must be thin. we want to make it display many important features and values for the decision 
making. we want to combine machine state with game goals and scores.
